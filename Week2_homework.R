set.seed(15)
hw2 <- runif(50, 4, 50)
hw2 <- replace(hw2, c(4,12,22,27), NA)
hw2

### Take your hw2 vector and removed all the NAs then select all the numbers between 14 and 38 inclusive, call this vector prob1.

hw2 <- hw2[!is.na(hw2)]
prob1 <- hw2[hw2 >= 14 & hw2 <= 38]
prob1

### Multiply each number in the prob1 vector by 3 to create a new vector called times3. Then add 10 to each number in your times3 
### vector to create a new vector called plus10.

times3 <- prob1 * 3
plus10 <- times3 + 10

### Select every other number in your plus10 vector by selecting the first number, not the second, the third, not the fourth, etc. 
### If youâ€™ve worked through these three problems in order, you should now have a vector that is 12 numbers long

plus10_select <- plus10[c(1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19,21,23)]
plus10_select
# can also just use plus10[c(TRUE, FALSE)]
final <- plus10[c(TRUE,FALSE)]
final
cbind(final, plus10_select)
